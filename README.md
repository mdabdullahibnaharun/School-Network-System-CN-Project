# School-Network-System-CN-Project

####
It is basically a network design project. This network can provide services, such as registration, school 
directories, course schedules, and email accounts, and many others. (Remember, network services are generally 
provided by servers). Collaborative software allows many users to work on a document or project concurrently. For 
example, educators can contribute their ideas about new curriculum standards by, email, or website of the school.
